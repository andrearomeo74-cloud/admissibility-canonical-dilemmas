# What the Admissibility Index (CI) Is Not

This document clarifies common misinterpretations of the admissibility index.

The goal is to prevent over-extension, misuse,
or category errors in reading this repository.

## CI Is Not an Optimization Target

CI is not something to be maximized.

A system with higher CI is not “better” in general.
CI simply indicates whether a given regime remains viable.

Maximizing CI blindly would recreate
the same over-optimization failures described in the dilemmas.

---

## CI Is Not a Predictive Model

CI does not predict system trajectories or outcomes.

It does not forecast collapse,
nor does it simulate dynamics.

CI functions as a boundary indicator,
not as a time-evolution model.

---

## CI Is Not a Unified Theory of Everything

The admissibility principle does not replace
domain-specific theories.

It does not explain mechanisms.

Each dilemma retains its own:
- dynamics,
- causal structure,
- governing equations.

CI addresses a different question:
when continuing to apply a mechanism
ceases to be structurally legitimate.

## Proper Use

CI should be used to:
- identify regime boundaries,
- explain why successful mechanisms fail at scale,
- justify stopping rules and transitions.

CI should not be used to:
- derive numerical predictions,
- replace existing models,
- justify universal optimization.
