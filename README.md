# Admissibility Canonical Dilemmas

This repository collects a set of canonical technical dilemmas that appear unrelated,
yet share the same structural cause: a missing criterion of admissibility.

Core idea:
Not everything that is technically possible, coherent, or optimizable
remains admissible once scale, cost, and complexity are included.

## Admissibility Principle

We use a minimal, domain-agnostic index:

CI = V / (E + I + S)

where:
- V: effective value produced by the system
- E: energetic/material cost
- I: informational/organizational burden
- S: scaling overhead (degrees of freedom, actors, time horizon, interactions)

A system remains viable only while CI stays above a context-dependent threshold.
When the threshold is crossed, the system changes regime.

## How to Use This Repo

1. Read `start_here.md`
2. Read dilemmas in order under `dilemmas/`
3. Use `unifying_principle.md` as the final compression layer

## What This Is / Is Not

This is:
- a law-of-limits framing (admissibility), not an optimization recipe
- a cross-domain map of regime transitions

This is not:
- a new physical theory
- a replacement for existing domain models
- policy advocacy
