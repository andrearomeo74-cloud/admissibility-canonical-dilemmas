# Unifying Principle of Admissibility

The dilemmas collected in this repository appear, on the surface,
to belong to unrelated domains: quantum physics, control theory,
biology, cognition, economics, and energy systems.

Despite this diversity, they share a single structural pattern.

## The Common Failure Mode

In all cases, system failure does not arise from malfunction,
error, or lack of optimization.

Instead, failure emerges when a system continues to operate,
optimize, or self-stabilize beyond the point at which its operation
remains admissible.

Technically correct behavior becomes structurally illegitimate.

## The Admissibility Structure

Across all domains, the same variables recur:

- Value produced by the system (V)
- Energetic or material cost (E)
- Informational and organizational burden (I)
- Scale of operation in time, space, or number of actors (S)

We express this as a minimal congruity index:

CI = V / (E + I + S)

This index is not a metric to be maximized.
It is a boundary indicator.

When CI falls below a context-dependent threshold,
the system undergoes a regime transition.

## Why Mechanism Is Not Enough

Each domain already has sophisticated mechanisms:
- decoherence in quantum physics,
- feedback in control systems,
- prediction minimization in cognition,
- protection and repair in biology,
- efficiency and optimization in economics.

These mechanisms explain *how* systems behave.

They do not explain *when continuing the same behavior
ceases to be legitimate*.

The admissibility principle fills this gap.

## A Law of Limits

Admissibility is not a new dynamic.
It is a law of limits.

It determines when:
- a description must change,
- an action must stop,
- an optimization must be abandoned,
- a system must transition to a new regime.

This is why the same principle appears
in fundamentally different domains.

## Scope

This repository does not propose interventions,
algorithms, or policies.

It provides a unifying conceptual boundary
for understanding regime transitions
in complex systems.
