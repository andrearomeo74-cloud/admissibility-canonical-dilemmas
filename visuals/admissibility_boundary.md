# Admissibility Boundary (Conceptual Diagram)

This conceptual diagram illustrates the admissibility principle
independently of any specific domain or numerical calibration.

## Axes

- Horizontal axis: Scale / Complexity
  (number of interacting elements, time horizon, degrees of freedom)

- Vertical axis: Effective Value
  (real-world function, viability, explanatory power)

---

## Behavior

As scale and complexity increase, the marginal value produced
by a system typically saturates or grows sub-linearly.

At the same time:
- energetic cost,
- informational burden,
- coordination overhead

increase super-linearly.

The admissibility index:

CI = V / (E + I + S)

decreases accordingly.

---

## Regime Boundary

When CI falls below a context-dependent threshold:

- the system does not fail mechanically,
- the mechanism may still function locally,
- but the regime becomes structurally inadmissible.

This boundary marks a qualitative regime transition,
not a gradual degradation.

---

## Key Insight

Admissibility loss is driven by scale,
not by local inefficiency or error.

Optimization can continue successfully
while the system as a whole becomes non-viable.
