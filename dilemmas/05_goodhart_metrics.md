# Metric Optimization and Goodhart Collapse

## The Canonical Dilemma

Across technical, economic, and organizational systems,
metrics are introduced to guide optimization and improve performance.

Yet a well-known failure repeatedly occurs:
systems that strongly optimize a chosen metric
produce outcomes increasingly detached from real-world value.

This phenomenon is commonly summarized by Goodhart’s Law:
"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

Despite its ubiquity, the structural cause remains underexplained.

## Standard Responses

Typical responses include:
- introducing multiple metrics,
- refining indicators,
- adding regularization,
- monitoring for manipulation.

These approaches mitigate symptoms.
They do not address the underlying condition
that makes metric optimization self-defeating.

## The Missing Question

The unresolved question is not how to design better metrics,
but when continued metric optimization becomes inadmissible
for the system it intends to guide.

There is no general criterion defining:
- when metrics decouple from value,
- when optimization incentives dominate outcomes,
- when measurement reshapes behavior destructively.

---

## Admissibility Reframing

From an admissibility perspective,
metric optimization remains valid
only while the informational and organizational burden
introduced by the metric remains proportionate to real value.

We express this schematically as:

CI = V / (E + I + S)

where:
- V represents real-world value produced,
- E the operational cost of optimization,
- I the informational burden imposed by measurement and incentives,
- S the scale of deployment across actors and time.

## Regime Transition

As systems scale and incentives tighten,
informational burden grows faster than value.

When CI falls below the admissibility threshold:
- metrics begin to dominate behavior,
- optimization targets replace underlying goals,
- system outputs lose correspondence with reality.

Goodhart effects mark a transition of regime,
not a failure of measurement design.

## Why This Matters

This reframing explains why:
- adding more metrics often worsens outcomes,
- tightly optimized organizations become brittle,
- reward-driven systems drift from their purpose.

The collapse does not occur because metrics are wrong,
but because optimization persists beyond admissible limits.

Measurement ceases to guide.
It begins to govern.
