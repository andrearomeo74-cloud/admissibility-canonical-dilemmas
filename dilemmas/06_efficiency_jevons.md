# Efficiency Gains and the Jevons Rebound

## The Canonical Dilemma

Technological progress is often framed as improved efficiency:
doing more with less energy, time, or resources.

Yet a recurrent paradox appears across domains:
efficiency gains frequently lead to increased total consumption,
not to the reductions they promise.

This phenomenon is known as the Jevons Paradox or rebound effect.

Despite extensive documentation, it is commonly treated
as a behavioral or policy issue rather than a structural one.

## Standard Explanations

Typical explanations state that:
- efficiency reduces unit cost,
- lower cost increases demand,
- total consumption rises.

These explanations describe *what happens*.
They do not explain *why efficiency improvements
systematically escape their intended bounds*.

## The Missing Question

The unresolved question is not whether rebound effects occur,
but when continued efficiency improvement becomes inadmissible
for the system in which it operates.

There is no general criterion indicating:
- when efficiency amplifies scale beyond control,
- when demand expansion overwhelms savings,
- when optimization accelerates resource exhaustion.

## Admissibility Reframing

From an admissibility perspective,
efficiency remains beneficial only while the scale it enables
remains proportionate to the value it delivers.

We express this schematically as:

CI = V / (E + I + S)

where:
- V represents real service or benefit delivered,
- E the total energy or resource cost,
- I the infrastructural and organizational overhead,
- S the scale expansion enabled by efficiency gains.

## Regime Transition

Efficiency improvements reduce local costs,
but often enable rapid growth in scale.

When scale expansion outpaces value creation,
CI falls below the admissibility threshold.

At this point:
- consumption rises despite efficiency,
- resource use accelerates,
- sustainability collapses.

The rebound effect signals a transition of regime,
not a failure of efficiency itself.

## Why This Matters

This reframing explains why:
- more efficient transport increases traffic,
- efficient data centers increase total energy demand,
- efficient production accelerates extraction.

Efficiency fails not because it is ineffective,
but because it is applied beyond admissible limits.

Without an admissibility boundary,
optimization becomes self-defeating.
