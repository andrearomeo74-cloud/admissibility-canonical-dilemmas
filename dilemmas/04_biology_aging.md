# Biological Aging as Loss of Admissibility

## The Canonical Dilemma

Biological aging is commonly described as the gradual accumulation
of damage, error, and dysfunction across molecular and cellular systems.

Yet many of the processes associated with aging originate as
protective and adaptive mechanisms:
- DNA damage response,
- cellular senescence,
- inflammatory signaling,
- repair and maintenance pathways.

The dilemma is simple and unresolved:
why do mechanisms that preserve viability
become the primary drivers of decline?

## Standard Explanations

Aging research explains decline through:
- oxidative stress,
- telomere attrition,
- epigenetic drift,
- mitochondrial dysfunction,
- chronic inflammation.

These mechanisms describe *what* changes with age.
They do not explain *why protective strategies
inevitably become pathological*.

## The Missing Question

The unresolved question is not which mechanisms fail,
but when continuing to apply the same protective strategies
ceases to be admissible for the organism as a whole.

Biology lacks a formal criterion indicating:
- when repair becomes over-repair,
- when protection becomes rigidity,
- when inflammation becomes destructive.

## Admissibility Reframing

From an admissibility perspective,
aging is not a breakdown of regulation,
but the consequence of regulatory strategies
exceeding their viable regime.

We express this schematically as:

CI = V / (E + I + S)

where:
- V represents maintained biological function,
- E the energetic cost of protection and repair,
- I the regulatory and signaling burden,
- S the temporal and tissue scale over which mechanisms operate.

---

## Regime Transition

Over time, informational burden and energetic cost accumulate.
Protective responses persist beyond their optimal context.

When CI falls below the admissibility threshold:
- senescence shifts from protective to harmful,
- inflammation becomes chronic,
- tissue function degrades.

Aging emerges as a regime transition,
not as a sudden failure.

---

## Why This Matters

This reframing explains why:
- eliminating damage alone does not halt aging,
- suppressing symptoms without addressing scale fails,
- long-lived organisms balance repair and restraint.

Aging is not caused by insufficient protection,
but by protection continuing beyond admissible limits.

The organism remains coherent,
yet structurally non-viable.
