# Quantum Measurement and Loss of Admissibility

## The Canonical Dilemma

Quantum mechanics provides an exact and highly successful dynamical description
of microscopic systems. Yet, when a measurement occurs, the theory appears to
require a discontinuous transition from superposition to a definite outcome.

The canonical question has been framed for decades as:
"How does the wavefunction collapse?"

Despite many interpretations, no consensus exists.

## Standard Explanations

Decoherence theory explains how interaction with an environment suppresses
interference terms through entanglement with many degrees of freedom.

This explains:
- why superpositions become unobservable,
- why classical outcomes are stable,
- why interference disappears at macroscopic scales.

However, decoherence alone does not answer a deeper question.

## The Missing Question

Decoherence describes *how* coherence is lost.
It does not determine *when a quantum description ceases to be admissible*.

Two systems may experience comparable decoherence while differing in whether
quantum behavior can, even in principle, be recovered.

The theory lacks a validity boundary.

## Admissibility Reframing

From an admissibility perspective, measurement is not a special dynamical event.

A quantum description remains valid only while the informational and scaling
costs required to sustain coherence remain proportionate to the value of the
description.

We express this condition schematically as:

CI = V / (E + I + S)

where:
- V represents the informational value of maintaining a quantum description,
- E the energetic cost of isolation and control,
- I the informational burden of managing entanglement and coherence,
- S the scale of environmental degrees of freedom involved.

---

## Regime Transition

When environmental scale and information dispersion dominate,
CI falls below the admissibility threshold.

At that point:
- the quantum description is no longer legitimate,
- not because it is false,
- but because maintaining it is structurally unsustainable.

The system transitions to a classical regime.

Measurement corresponds to a loss of admissibility,
not to a physical collapse mechanism.

## Why This Matters

This reframing:
- avoids introducing new dynamics,
- preserves standard quantum mechanics,
- explains the irreversibility of measurement,
- clarifies why classical outcomes are enforced at scale.

The quantum-to-classical transition becomes a boundary problem,
not an interpretational mystery.
