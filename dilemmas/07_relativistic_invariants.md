# Relativistic Invariants as an Admissibility Constraint

In special relativity, the energy–momentum relation

E² = p²c² + m₀²c⁴

acts as an invariant that constrains the space of physically admissible states
before any dynamics is considered.

Not every combination of energy and momentum is allowed.
States violating the invariant are not "unstable" — they are simply inadmissible.

## Canonical Dilemma

Modern engineering, computation, and optimization often proceed by:
- exploring trajectories first
- correcting violations later

Physics does the opposite:
- constrain the state space first
- allow dynamics only within admissible bounds

## Structural Parallel

The admissibility index CI = V / (E + I + S) plays the same structural role:

It does not optimize outcomes.
It excludes regimes where scale, cost, or complexity overwhelm value.

## Failure Mode

Ignoring invariants leads to:
- unphysical states in physics
- non-viable systems in complex domains

Admissibility is not a performance metric.
It is a boundary condition.
